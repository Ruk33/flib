flib
    just a simple library for things that i usually use and need.

usage/installation
    include "flib.h" in your code and flib.c in your build script.
    look at the test.c file and build.sh/bat as an example.

tests
    on windows, build and run the tests by executing build.bat.
    on linux, build and run the tests by executing build.sh.

notes
    - no heap memory is allocated.
    - null can be safely used as parameter in all functions.
    - no dependencies (only stdarg.h for strf)

license
